This is my app Kaiju Shoes it's an eCommerce website which allows users to browse an assortment of their favorite shoes. Some of the technologies I implemented in developing this project were JavaScript, React.js, Node, Express, Sequelize, and ReactIcons.

The main features of the app include a login/sign up page, a tab to take you to the shoe collection, view shoes by gender and kids, as well as a FAQ page. When the user enters the app they are brought to the home page. From there they can navigate to their desired shoe product. On the login page they can create an account if needed. However if they already have an account they are able to login and will be redirected to the home page. They’ll know they’re logged in once their username appears in the top right corner.
